These shapes are rock (a closed fist), paper (a flat hand), and scissors (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). Scissors is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating victory or peace) except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.</p>
